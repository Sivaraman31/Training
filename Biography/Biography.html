            Depp made his debut in the horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), before rising to prominence as a teen idol on the television series 21 Jump Street
            (1987–1990).In the 1990s, Depp acted mostly in independent films, often playing eccentric characters.
            These included What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Benny and Joon (1993), Dead Man (1995), Donnie Brasco (1997) and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998).
            Depp also began collaborating with director Tim Burton, starring in Edward Scissorhands (1990), Ed Wood (1994) and Sleepy Hollow (1999).
        </p>
        <p>In the 2000s, Depp became one of the most commercially successful film stars by playing Captain Jack Sparrow in the swashbuckler film series Pirates of the Caribbean (2003–present). He received critical praise for Finding Neverland (2004), and continued his commercially successful collaboration with Tim Burton with the films Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Corpse Bride (2005), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), and Alice in Wonderland (2010). In 2012, Depp was one of the world's biggest film stars,[1][2] and was listed by the Guinness World Records as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million.[3] During the 2010s, Depp began producing films through his company, Infinitum Nihil, and formed the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry.</p>

        <section>
            <h1 style="text-shadow: 1px 2px 7px red; ">Early life and ancestry</h1><hr />
            <p>John Christopher Depp II was born on June 9, 1963, in Owensboro, Kentucky,[4][5][6] the youngest of four children of waitress Betty Sue Palmer (née Wells)[7] and civil engineer John Christopher Depp.[8][9] Depp's family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in Miramar, Florida in 1970.[10] His parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15,[10][11] and his mother later married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called "an inspiration".</p>
            <p>Depp was gifted a guitar by his mother when he was 12 years old, and began playing in various bands.[10] He dropped out of Miramar High School aged 16 in 1979 to become a rock musician. He attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician.[10] In 1980, Depp began playing guitar in a band called The Kids. After modest local success in Florida, the band moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method. In addition to the band, Depp worked a variety of odd jobs, such as in telemarketing. In December 1983, Depp married make-up artist Lori Anne Allison,[5] the sister of his band's bassist and singer. The Kids split up before signing a record deal in 1984, and Depp subsequently began collaborating with the band Rock City Angels.[14] He co-wrote their song "Mary", which appeared on their debut Geffen Records album Young Man's Blues.[15] Depp and Allison divorced in 1985.</p>
            <p>Depp is primarily of English descent, with some French, German, Irish, and African ancestry.[16] His surname comes from a French Huguenot immigrant (Pierre Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700). He is also descended from colonial freedom fighter Elizabeth Key Grinstead (1630–1665), daughter of an English planter and his African slave.[17][18][19] In interviews in 2002 and 2011, Depp claimed to have Native American ancestry, stating, "I guess I have some Native American somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American, she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek Indian."[20][21][22] Depp's claims came under scrutiny when Indian Country Today stated that Depp had never inquired about his heritage nor was he recognized as a member of the Cherokee Nation.[23] This led to criticism from the Native American community, as Depp has no documented Native ancestry,[23] and Native community leaders refer to him as "a non-Indian".[23][24] Depp's choice to portray Tonto, a Native American character, in The Lone Ranger was criticized,[23][24] along with his choice to name his rock band "Tonto's Giant Nuts".[25][26][27][28] During the promotion for The Lone Ranger, Depp was adopted as an honorary son by LaDonna Harris, a member of the Comanche Nation, making him an honorary member of her family but not a member of any tribe.[29] Critical response to his claims from the Native community increased after this, including satirical portrayals of Depp by Native comedians.[26][27][28] An ad featuring Depp and Native American imagery, by Dior for the fragrance "Sauvage", was pulled in 2019 after being accused of cultural appropriation and racism.</p>

                <p>In the early 1980s, Depp's then-wife Lori Ann Allison introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to pursue an acting career.[10] Depp has also credited James Dean as the catalyst that made him want to become an actor.[34] Depp's first film role was in the horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), in which he played the boyfriend of the main character and one of Freddy Krueger's victims.[10] After a starring role in the comedy Private Resort (1985), Depp was cast in the lead role of the skating drama Thrashin' (1986) by the film's director, but the decision was later overridden by its producer.[35][36] Instead, Depp appeared in a minor supporting role as a Vietnamese-speaking private in Oliver Stone's Vietnam War drama Platoon (1986). Depp became a teen idol during the late 1980s, when he starred as an undercover police officer in a high school operation in the Fox television series 21 Jump Street, which premiered in 1987.[10] He accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest, who inspired him. Despite his success, Depp felt that the series "forced [him] into the role of product".[37]</p>

                <p>Disillusioned by his experiences as a teen idol in 21 Jump Street, Depp began choosing roles which he found more interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office.[37][38] His first film release in 1990 was John Waters' Cry-Baby, a musical comedy set in the 1950s. Although it was not a box office success upon its initial release,[39] over the years it has gained cult classic status.[40] Also in 1990, Depp played the title character in Tim Burton's romantic fantasy film Edward Scissorhands opposite Dianne Wiest and Winona Ryder. The film was a commercial and critical success with a domestic gross of $53 million.[41] In preparation for the role, Depp watched many Charlie Chaplin films to study the idea of creating sympathy without dialogue.[42] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Depp's performance stating that he "artfully expresses the fierce longing in gentle Edward; it's a terrific performance",[43] while Rita Kempley of The Washington Post stated that he "brings the eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright black eyes and the tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands.[44] Depp earned his first Golden Globe nomination for the film.</p>
                <h2 style="text-shadow: 1px 2px 7px red; ">2003–2011: Pirates of the Caribbean, commercial and critical success</h2>
                <p>In 2003, Depp starred in the Walt Disney Pictures adventure film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which was a major box office success.[38] He earned widespread acclaim for his comic performance as pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and received Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations and won a Screen Actor's Guild Award for Best Actor as well as an MTV Movie Award. Depp has said that Sparrow is "definitely a big part of me",[68] and that he modeled the character after The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards[69] and cartoon skunk Pepé Le Pew.[70] Studio executives had at first been ambivalent about Depp's portrayal,[71] but the character became popular with audiences.[38] In his other film release in 2003, Robert Rodriguez' action film Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Depp played a corrupt CIA agent. A moderate box-office success,[72] it received average to good reviews, with Depp's performance in particular receiving praise.[73][74]</p>
                <p>Depp next starred as an author with writer's block in the thriller Secret Window (2004), based on a short story by Stephen King. It was a moderate commercial success but received mixed reviews.[75][76] Released around the same time, the British-Australian independent film The Libertine (2004) saw Depp portray the seventeenth-century poet and rake, the Earl of Rochester. It had only limited release, and received mainly negative reviews. Depp's third film of 2004, Finding Neverland, was more positively received by the critics, and earned him his second Academy Award nomination as well as Golden Globe, BAFTA, and SAG nominations for his performance as Scottish author J. M. Barrie. Depp also made a brief cameo appearance in the French film Happily Ever After (2004).</p>

                <p>Prior to his acting career, Depp was a guitarist, and has later featured on songs by Oasis, Shane MacGowan, Iggy Pop, Vanessa Paradis, Aerosmith, Marilyn Manson, and The New Basement Tapes, among others. He also performed with Manson at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards in 2012.[172] Depp played guitar on the soundtrack of his films Chocolat and Once Upon a Time in Mexico, and has appeared in music videos for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, The Lemonheads, Avril Lavigne and Paul McCartney. In the 1990s, he was also a member of P, a musical group featuring Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones.</p>
                <p>In 2015, Depp formed the supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry; the band also includes Bruce Witkin, his friend from his 1980s band, The Kids. Hollywood Vampires released their self-titled debut studio album in September 2015. It featured eleven classic rock covers, as well as three original songs (all co-written by Depp).[173] The band made their live debut at The Roxy in Los Angeles in September 2015,[174] and has since done two world tours in 2016[175] and 2018.[176][177] Their second studio album, Rise, was released in June 2019 and consists mostly of original material, including songs written by Depp. The album also features a cover version of David Bowie's "Heroes", sung by Depp.[178] In 2020, Depp released a cover of John Lennon's "Isolation" with guitarist Jeff Beck, and stated that they would be releasing more music together in the future.</p>

                <p>Depp and makeup artist Lori Anne Allison were married from 1983 until 1985.[191] In the late 1980s, he was engaged to actresses Jennifer Grey and Sherilyn Fenn before proposing in 1990 to his Edward Scissorhands co-star Winona Ryder, for whom he tattooed "WINONA FOREVER" on his right arm.[157] In 1994–1997, he was in a relationship with English model Kate Moss.[192] Following his breakup from Moss, Depp began a relationship with French actress and singer Vanessa Paradis, whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate in France in 1998. They have two children, daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp (born 1999) and son John Christopher "Jack" Depp III (born 2002).[193] Depp stated that having children has given him a "real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything. ...You cannot plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny. All the math finally worked."[68] Depp and Paradis announced that they had separated in June 2012.[194]</p>
                <h2 style="text-shadow: 1px 2px 7px red; ">Relationship with Amber Heard</h2>
                <p>Following the end of his relationship with Vanessa Paradis, Depp began dating actress Amber Heard, with whom he had co-starred in The Rum Diary (2011).[195] They were married in a civil ceremony in February 2015.[196][197][198] Heard filed for divorce in May 2016 and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp, alleging in her court declaration that he had been verbally and physically abusive throughout their relationship, usually while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.[199][200][201][189] Depp denied this and alleged that she was "attempting to secure a premature financial resolution".[202][199][203] A settlement was reached in August 2016,[204] and the divorce was finalized in January 2017.[205] Heard dismissed the restraining order, and they issued a joint statement saying that their "relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm."[204] Depp paid Heard a settlement of US$7 million, which she pledged to donate[206] to the ACLU[207] and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.[208][209] In August 2021, a US judge ruled that the ACLU must disclose documents to determine if Heard donated the $7 million to the charity, after Depp’s lawyer claimed her donation promise was a lie.</p>
